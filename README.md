# sqlalchemy-challenge
This project analyzes climate data to help plan a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. Part 1 uses Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used to perform the analysis and visualize the results. In part 2, a Flask API is built based on the queries from part 1.
